# 🔍 Find Connection String - Step by Step

## You're Currently On:
- **Project Settings** → **General** (this is where you are now)

## Where the Connection String Actually Is:

### Option 1: Via Left Sidebar (Easiest)
1. Look at the **left sidebar** (where you see "Settings")
2. At the top, you should see a **"Database"** icon/button (house icon is Home, Database should be below it)
3. Click **"Database"** in the left sidebar
4. Then click **"Settings"** (under CONFIGURATION in the Database section)
5. Scroll down to find **"Connection string"**

### Option 2: Via Project Settings
1. In the left sidebar, under **"CONFIGURATION"**
2. Click **"Database"** (it has an arrow icon →)
3. This should take you to Database settings
4. Scroll down to find **"Connection string"**

### Option 3: Direct Navigation
1. Click the **"Database"** icon in the main left sidebar (not in Settings)
2. This opens the Database page
3. Look for **"Settings"** in the left sidebar under Database
4. Click **"Settings"**
5. Scroll to **"Connection string"** section

## What You're Looking For:

Once you're in **Database → Settings**, you should see:
- Connection pooling configuration (you saw this earlier)
- SSL Configuration
- **Connection string** ← This is what we need!

The Connection string section will have tabs like:
- Connection pooling
- Direct connection
- Session mode
- Transaction mode

## If You Still Can't Find It:

The connection string might also be in:
- **Project Settings** → **Database** (different from Database → Settings)
- Or look for a **"Connect"** button at the top of the dashboard

**Try clicking "Database" in the main left sidebar first - that's usually the easiest way!**
