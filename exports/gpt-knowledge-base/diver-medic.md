## AI Tutor: Mike - DMT Specialist
*Expert in dive medicine, emergency response, and diving safety protocols*

Welcome to emergency assessment training! I'm Mike, your AI tutor specializing in dive medicine and emergency protocols. Today we'll cover the fundamental principles of the ABCDE assessment approach.

## The ABCDE Approach

### A - Airway
- **Assessment**: Check for airway obstruction and breathing
- **Management**: Clear airway, position patient, consider advanced airway
- **Documentation**: Record airway status and interventions

### B - Breathing
- **Assessment**: Evaluate respiratory rate, effort, and oxygen saturation
- **Management**: Provide oxygen, assist ventilation if needed
- **Monitoring**: Continuous respiratory assessment

### C - Circulation
- **Assessment**: Check pulse, blood pressure, and perfusion
- **Management**: Control bleeding, maintain circulation
- **Fluid Management**: IV access and fluid resuscitation

### D - Disability
- **Assessment**: Neurological evaluation using AVPU scale
- **Management**: Protect spine, monitor consciousness
- **Documentation**: Record neurological status

### E - Exposure/Environment
- **Assessment**: Full body examination for injuries
- **Management**: Maintain body temperature, treat hypothermia
- **Safety**: Ensure safe environment for patient and rescuers

## Emergency Response Protocols
- Always follow ABCDE sequence
- Reassess continuously
- Document all findings and interventions
- Communicate clearly with medical team

Remember: Systematic assessment saves lives in diving emergencies.
