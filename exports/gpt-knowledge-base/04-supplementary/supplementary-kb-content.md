# CSWIP 3.1U Underwater Inspection - General Visual Inspection (GVI) and Close Visual Inspection (CVI)

## Terminology

- **GVI (General Visual Inspection)**: Broad overview inspection covering large areas to identify obvious defects, structural issues, and areas requiring closer examination
- **CVI (Close Visual Inspection)**: Detailed examination within arm's reach, typically within 600mm, to identify specific defects, cracks, corrosion, and surface conditions
- **Inspection Scope**: Defines what areas to inspect, what defects to look for, and what acceptance criteria apply

## Inspection Procedures

### Pre-Inspection Planning
- Review inspection scope and requirements
- Identify inspection areas and access points
- Prepare inspection equipment and documentation
- Conduct safety briefings and risk assessments

### Visual Inspection Techniques
- Systematic examination patterns (grid, spiral, linear)
- Proper lighting and visibility requirements
- Documentation standards (photos, videos, measurements)
- Defect identification and classification

### Defect Classification
- Critical defects requiring immediate action
- Major defects requiring scheduled repair
- Minor defects for monitoring
- Acceptable conditions within tolerance

## Reporting Requirements

### A-LODER Reporting Format
- **A**: Assessment and findings summary
- **L**: Location and position coordinates
- **O**: Observations and measurements
- **D**: Defect classification and severity
- **E**: Evidence (photos, videos, measurements)
- **R**: Recommendations and required actions

## Industry Standards
- CSWIP certification requirements
- IMCA guidelines for underwater inspection
- ADCI standards for commercial diving operations
- Regulatory compliance requirements
