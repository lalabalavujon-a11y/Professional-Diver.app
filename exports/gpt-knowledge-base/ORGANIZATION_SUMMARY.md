   - Test CSWIP and DMT protocol queries

## ✅ Verification Tests

After each category upload, test with these queries:

### Foundation Category
- "What is air diver certification?"
- "What does an ALST do?"

### Specialized Category
- "What is NDT inspection?"
- "What is the ABCDE protocol?"
- "What does an LST do?"

### Advanced Category
- "What is saturation diving?"
- "How does hyperbaric treatment work?"
- "What are commercial dive supervisor responsibilities?"

### Supplementary Category
- "What is CSWIP 3.1U?"
