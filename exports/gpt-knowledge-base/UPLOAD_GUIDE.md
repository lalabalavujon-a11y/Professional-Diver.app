## Step-by-Step Upload Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Access to OpenAI GPT configuration
2. Admin/editor permissions for your GPT
3. All files from the export directory

### Upload Process

#### Step 1: Access GPT Configuration
1. Navigate to your Diver Well GPT in OpenAI
2. Click "Edit" or "Configure" to access settings
3. Navigate to the "Knowledge" or "Knowledge Base" section

#### Step 2: Upload Foundation Files (Category 01)
1. Upload files from `01-foundation/` folder first
2. Upload in this order:
   1. Air Diver Certification
   2. Assistant Life Support Technician (ALST)
3. Wait for each file to process completely
4. Verify uploads appear in your knowledge base list

#### Step 3: Upload Specialized Files (Category 02)
1. Upload files from `02-specialized/` folder
2. Upload in this order:
   1. Life Support Technician (LST)
   2. Inspection & Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
   3. Diver Medic Technician (DMT)
3. Verify each upload completes successfully

#### Step 4: Upload Advanced Files (Category 03)
1. Upload files from `03-advanced/` folder
2. Upload in this order:
   1. Saturation Diver Training
   2. Hyperbaric Chamber Operations
   3. Advanced Underwater Welding
   4. Commercial Dive Supervisor
3. Verify all advanced content is accessible

#### Step 5: Upload Supplementary Content (Category 04)
1. Upload files from `04-supplementary/` folder
2. This includes CSWIP protocols and DMT emergency procedures
3. Verify specialized protocols are searchable

### Verification Steps

After each category upload:

1. **Test Search Functionality**
   - Ask GPT a question specific to that category
   - Verify it can find and reference the uploaded content
   - Check that responses are accurate and detailed

2. **Verify File Processing**
   - Check that all files show as "Processed" or "Ready"
   - Ensure no files are stuck in "Processing" state
   - Verify file sizes match expected values

3. **Test Cross-References**
   - Ask questions that span multiple categories
   - Verify GPT can connect related concepts
   - Check that foundational knowledge supports advanced topics

### Best Practices

1. **Upload in Batches**
   - Upload one category at a time
   - Wait for processing to complete before next category
   - Test after each category upload

2. **Monitor File Sizes**
   - OpenAI GPT has file size limits (typically 512MB per file)
   - Our files range from 8680 bytes to 58057 bytes
   - All files are well within limits

3. **Test Incrementally**
   - Test knowledge base after each category
   - Verify content is searchable and accurate
   - Document any issues immediately

4. **Maintain Order**
   - Follow the upload sequence strictly
   - Foundation files must be uploaded first
   - Advanced files depend on foundation knowledge

### Troubleshooting

#### File Won't Upload
- Check file size (must be under 512MB)
- Verify file format (must be .md, .txt, .pdf, etc.)
- Check file permissions
- Try uploading one file at a time

#### Content Not Searchable
- Wait for processing to complete (can take several minutes)
- Verify file was uploaded successfully
- Check file format and encoding
- Try re-uploading if issues persist

#### Inaccurate Responses
- Verify all files in a category are uploaded
- Check that upload order was followed
- Test with specific questions from uploaded content
- Consider re-uploading if content seems incomplete

### Post-Upload Verification

After all files are uploaded:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test questions from each category
   - Verify cross-category knowledge connections
   - Check that supplementary protocols are accessible

2. **Content Verification**
   - Ask about CSWIP 3.1U/3.2U/3.4U protocols
   - Test DMT SAFE/ABCDE/ATOMFC protocols
   - Verify all track content is searchable

3. **Performance Check**
   - Test response accuracy
   - Verify response speed
   - Check for any missing content
