# 🔍 Connection String Location - Alternative Places

## You're Currently On:
- **Database** → **Settings** (this is where you are now)

## The Connection String is NOT Here - Try These:

### Option 1: Project Settings → Database (Most Likely!)
1. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** or **"Settings"** at the top
2. In the left sidebar, under **"PROJECT SETTINGS"**, you should see various options
3. Look for **"Database"** in the PROJECT SETTINGS section (NOT in CONFIGURATION)
4. Click it - the connection string should be there

### Option 2: Look for "Connect" Button
1. At the top of the dashboard, look for a **"Connect"** button
2. Click it - it usually shows connection strings and connection info

### Option 3: API Section
1. Go to **Project Settings** → **API** (or look for "API Keys")
2. Sometimes connection strings are shown there alongside API keys

### Option 4: Check the Main Dashboard
1. Go back to the **Home/Dashboard** (click the house icon)
2. Look for any **"Connect"** or **"Connection info"** widgets/cards
3. Or look for a **"Getting Started"** section that might have connection strings

### Option 5: SQL Editor
1. Go to **Database** → **SQL Editor**
2. Sometimes connection info is shown in the SQL Editor interface

## What the Connection String Section Looks Like:

When you find it, you should see:
- A section titled **"Connection string"** or **"Connection info"**
- Tabs for: **Connection pooling**, **Direct connection**, **Session mode**, **Transaction mode**
- The actual connection string in a code block or input field

## Quick Test:

Since we already have the direct connection string format, we could also try:
- Using the connection pooling format manually
- Or checking if the project just needs more time to fully activate

**Try going to Project Settings → Database (in PROJECT SETTINGS section, not CONFIGURATION)!**
