I'm Lisa Thompson, your AI tutor specializing in underwater communication. Effective communication is critical for diver safety and operational success.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Master underwater communication methods and signals\n- Understand life-line signal protocols\n- Learn hand signal systems for diving operations\n- Develop clear communication procedures\n- Practice emergency communication protocols\n\n## Underwater Communication Methods\n\n### Life-Line Signals\nThe life-line (umbilical) is the primary communication method for commercial diving operations.\n\n#### Standard Life-Line Signals\n- **1 Pull**: \"Are you OK?\" / \"I'm OK\"\n- **2 Pulls**: \"I'm going up\" / \"Give me slack\"\n- **3 Pulls**: \"I'm going down\" / \"Take up slack\"\n- **4 Pulls**: \"EMERGENCY - Pull me up immediately\"\n- **Continuous Pulling**: \"EMERGENCY - Pull me up NOW\"\n\n#### Communication Signals\n- **1 Pull, Pause, 1 Pull**: \"Stop\" / \"Hold position\"\n- **2 Pulls, Pause, 2 Pulls**: \"Move forward\" / \"Proceed\"\n- **3 Pulls, Pause, 3 Pulls**: \"Move back\" / \"Return\"\n- **Rapid Pulls**: \"Attention\" / \"Something wrong\"\n\n### Hand Signals\nHand signals are essential when divers are in visual contact.\n\n#### Standard Hand Signals\n- **Thumbs Up**: \"Going up\" / \"OK\"\n- **Thumbs Down**: \"Going down\"\n- **OK Sign**: \"I'm OK\" / \"Everything fine\"\n- **Hand Across Throat**: \"Out of air\" / \"Emergency\"\n- **Hand Waving**: \"Attention\" / \"Help needed\"\n- **Pointing**: \"Look at this\" / \"Direction\"\n- **Fist**: \"Stop\" / \"Hold\"\n\n#### Work Signals\n- **Pointing with Index Finger**: \"This way\" / \"Direction\"\n- **Open Hand, Palm Down**: \"Stop work\"\n- **Open Hand, Palm Up**: \"Continue work\"\n- **Tapping Tool**: \"Tool needed\" / \"Tool problem\"\n\n### Voice Communication\nWhen using full-face masks or helmets with communication systems:\n\n#### Communication Protocols\n- **Clear Speech**: Speak clearly and slowly\n- **Standard Terminology**: Use industry-standard terms\n- **Confirmation**: Always confirm receipt of messages\n- **Emergency Priority**: Emergency communications take priority\n\n#### Standard Phrases\n- \"Diver to surface, do you copy?\"\n- \"Surface to diver, go ahead\"\n- \"Stand by\" (wait)\n- \"Roger\" (message received and understood)\n- \"Negative\" (no / cannot comply)\n- \"Affirmative\" (yes / will comply)\n\n## Communication Equipment\n\n### Life-Line Systems\n- **Umbilical**: Contains air supply, communication wire, and safety line\n- **Communication Wire**: Transmits voice signals\n- **Safety Line**: Physical connection to surface\n- **Tendon**: Separate safety line (backup)\n\n### Voice Communication Systems\n- **Hard-Wire Systems**: Direct connection via umbilical\n- **Wireless Systems**: Acoustic or radio communication\n- **Full-Face Masks**: Enable voice communication\n- **Helmets**: Standard commercial diving communication\n\n### Emergency Communication\n- **Backup Signals**: Life-line signals when voice fails\n- **Surface Signals**: Visual signals to surface support\n- **Emergency Procedures**: Clear emergency communication protocols\n\n## Communication Procedures\n\n### Pre-Dive Communication Check\n1. **Equipment Test**: Test communication equipment before dive\n2. **Signal Review**: Review standard signals with tender\n3. **Emergency Signals**: Confirm emergency signal procedures\n4. **Backup Methods**: Establish backup communication methods\n\n### During Dive Communication\n1. **Regular Check-Ins**: Periodic communication with surface\n2. **Status Updates**: Report position and status regularly\n3. **Work Progress**: Communicate work progress\n4. **Problem Reporting**: Immediately report any problems\n\n### Emergency Communication\n1. **Signal First**: Use life-line signals for immediate attention\n2. **Voice Follow-Up**: Provide details via voice if possible\n3. **Surface Response**: Surface must acknowledge all emergency signals\n4. **Clear Instructions**: Follow surface instructions precisely\n\n## Practice Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Communication Failure\nYour voice communication fails during a dive. How do you communicate with the surface?\n\n**AI Tutor Guidance**:\n1. Immediately use life-line signals (4 pulls for emergency)\n2. Surface will respond with life-line signals\n3. Use hand signals if tender is visible\n4. Follow emergency ascent procedures if needed\n\n### Scenario 2: Tool Problem\nYou need a different tool underwater. How do you communicate this?\n\n**AI Tutor Guidance**:\n1. Use hand signal for \"tool needed\"\n2. Describe tool via voice communication\n3. Surface will send tool down on tool line\n4. Confirm receipt of correct tool\n\n## Assessment Questions\n\n### Question 1\nWhat is the standard emergency signal on a life-line?\n- A) 1 pull\n- B) 2 pulls\n- C) 3 pulls\n- D) 4 pulls\n\n**Correct Answer**: D) 4 pulls\n\n### Question 2\nWhat does the \"OK\" hand signal mean underwater?\n- A) Going up\n- B) I'm OK / Everything fine\n- C) Emergency\n- D) Stop\n\n**Correct Answer**: B) I'm OK / Everything fine\n\n### Question 3\nWhat should you do if voice communication fails?\n- A) Continue working\n- B) Use life-line signals\n- C) Surface immediately\n- D) Wait for communication to restore\n\n**Correct Answer**: B) Use life-line signals\n\n## Professional Standards\n- Always test communication equipment before diving\n- Use standard signals consistently\n- Confirm receipt of all messages\n- Report communication problems immediately\n- Practice communication procedures regularly\n\n## Next Steps\nIn the next lesson, we'll explore problem-solving drills and troubleshooting techniques for air diving operations.\n\nRemember: Clear communication saves lives. Master these signals and procedures - they could save your life or a teammate's life.",
